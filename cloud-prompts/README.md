# Cloud Computing Prompts

A collection of AI prompts specifically designed for cloud computing tasks, comparisons, and optimizations.

## Purpose

These prompts help you effectively utilize AI for cloud-related tasks such as:
- Comparing services across different cloud providers
- Optimizing cloud costs and resource utilization
- Understanding cloud architectural patterns and best practices
- Making informed decisions about cloud migrations
- Troubleshooting cloud infrastructure issues

## Available Prompts

### [Compare Cloud Services](compare-cloud-services-prompt.md)
Generate comprehensive, evidence-based comparisons between similar services from different cloud providers. This prompt guides the AI to produce detailed analyses covering technical specifications, pricing, ideal use cases, and migration considerations.

**Use when you need to:**
- Evaluate similar services across AWS, Azure, GCP, or other cloud providers
- Make an informed decision based on specific criteria and requirements
- Understand the trade-offs between different cloud offerings
- Plan migrations between cloud platforms

### [Optimize Cloud Costs](optimize-cloud-cost-prompt.md)
Create detailed plans for reducing cloud spending while maintaining performance and reliability. This prompt helps identify cost-saving opportunities, rightsizing strategies, and architectural improvements.

**Use when you need to:**
- Reduce your monthly cloud bill
- Find unused or over-provisioned resources
- Implement cost-effective architectural patterns
- Create a systematic approach to cloud cost management

### [Explain Cloud Architecture](explain-cloud-architecture-prompt.md)
Get clear, comprehensive explanations of cloud architectural patterns, services, and best practices. This prompt guides the AI to create educational content about cloud concepts with relevant examples.

**Use when you need to:**
- Understand complex cloud architectural patterns
- Learn about specific cloud services in depth
- Evaluate the pros and cons of different cloud approaches
- Explain cloud concepts to stakeholders or team members

## How to Use These Prompts Effectively

1. **Be specific about your context**
   - Include your specific industry, workload characteristics, and constraints
   - Mention existing technologies and cloud services you're already using
   - Specify any compliance or geographical requirements

2. **Customize the comparison criteria**
   - Prioritize the factors most important to your use case
   - Add domain-specific requirements relevant to your industry
   - Include future scalability needs, not just current requirements

3. **Provide sufficient technical details**
   - Include specific performance requirements where applicable
   - Mention integration requirements with other systems
   - Specify any technical constraints or preferences

4. **Request real-world examples**
   - Ask for case studies or examples similar to your situation
   - Request practical implementation considerations
   - Ask for potential pitfalls or challenges you might face
