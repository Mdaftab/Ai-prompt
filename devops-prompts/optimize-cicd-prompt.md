# AI Prompt: Optimize CI/CD Pipeline

**Task:** Analyze a description of a CI/CD pipeline and suggest potential optimizations for speed, cost, or reliability.

**Input:** Provide a description of your CI/CD pipeline, including the steps involved, tools used, and any known bottlenecks or areas of concern.

**Example Input:**

```
Pipeline Description:
1. Pull code from Git repository.
2. Install dependencies (npm install).
3. Run unit tests (jest).
4. Build application (webpack).
5. Create Docker image.
6. Push Docker image to registry.
7. Deploy to staging environment (kubectl apply).

Tools: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, npm, jest, webpack.
Bottlenecks: Dependency installation is slow. Docker image build takes a long time.
```

**Expected Output:**

Suggestions for optimizing the pipeline, including:
*   Specific steps that could be improved.
*   Alternative tools or approaches.
*   Strategies for reducing build time, cost, or increasing reliability.
